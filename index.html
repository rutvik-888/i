      <h1>Chelli 💕
You hold a special place in my heart ❤. My day doesn't go by without talking to you. I cannot emphasize enough how much you mean to me No one cared for me as you do. I never want to leave you. I don't even know why I am writing this, as my love and devotion for you is something that goes beyond words. But I felt compelled to express it, to let you know that you are always on my mind and in my heart. 🥺 Please promise me that you will never leave me. Your presence in my life brings me comfort, and your absence would leave an irreplaceable void. I don't know what more to say, except that you are the most precious person in my life🌏. love you💝, i miss you and I hope we can always count on each other. 
Love you Chelli 💞
Now and forever ♾</h1>
